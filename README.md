# Anomaly-Detection-in-Transactions-Using-ML

Anomaly detection in transaction data is crucial for identifying unusual patterns that may indicate fraudulent activities or errors. Python offers several effective methods for this purpose, including the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model and machine learning algorithms like Isolation Forest.

**1. ARIMA Model for Anomaly Detection:**

The ARIMA model is widely used for time series forecasting and can be adapted for anomaly detection by modeling the expected behavior of transaction data and identifying deviations from this model.

*Implementation Steps:*

- **Data Preparation:** Import necessary libraries and load the transaction dataset.
- **Data Exploration:** Examine the dataset for missing values and perform exploratory data analysis.
- **Model Fitting:** Apply the ARIMA model to the training data to capture the underlying patterns.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Use the fitted model to predict expected values and identify transactions that significantly deviate from these predictions.

*Example Implementation:*

```python
import pandas as pd
import pyflux as pf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('transaction_data.csv', parse_dates=['datetime'], index_col='datetime')

# Fit the ARIMA model
model = pf.ARIMA(data=data, ar=11, ma=11, integ=0, target='transaction_amount')
model_fit = model.fit()

# Plot the fitted model
model.plot_fit(figsize=(20,8))
plt.show()
```

**2. Machine Learning Algorithms for Anomaly Detection:**

Machine learning algorithms, such as Isolation Forest, are effective for detecting anomalies in transaction data.

*Implementation Steps:*

- **Data Preparation:** Import necessary libraries and load the transaction dataset.
- **Data Exploration:** Examine the dataset for missing values and perform exploratory data analysis.
- **Model Training:** Train the Isolation Forest model on the dataset.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Use the trained model to predict anomalies in the transaction data.

*Example Implementation:*

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('transaction_data.csv')

# Initialize the Isolation Forest model
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.01)

# Fit the model
model.fit(data[['transaction_amount']])

# Predict anomalies
data['anomaly'] = model.predict(data[['transaction_amount']])

# Filter anomalies
anomalies = data[data['anomaly'] == -1]
```
